  @Summary
    This is the generated driver implementation file for the PWM2 driver using PIC10 / PIC12 / PIC16 / PIC18 MCUs

  @Description
    This header file provides implementations for driver APIs for PWM2.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  PIC10 / PIC12 / PIC16 / PIC18 MCUs - 1.77
        Device            :  PIC18F45K20
        Driver Version    :  2.01
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC8 2.05 and above
        MPLAB             :  MPLAB X 5.20
